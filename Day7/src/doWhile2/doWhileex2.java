/**
 * Make a class that implements a method that reads a list of marks between 
 * 0 and 100 from the user, one per line, and stops when the user introduces a -1. 
 * The program should output at the end (and only at the end) how many marks there 
 * were in total, how many were distinctions (70–100), how many were passes (50–69), 
 * how many failed (0–49), 
 * and how many were invalid (e.g. 150 or -3). Use readLine() exactly once. 
 * The output may look similar to this example:
